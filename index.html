            <p>This website serves as an overview of a few of my different talents, skills, projects, and accomplishments! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out! 
            I am currently working on a <strong>TON</strong> of personal projects, and will be posting all projects on the Projects page. The documents page will feature my
            work experience, education, and skills.

            <h2>The Objective</h2>
            <p>In <strong>Overthrone</strong>, each player competes to gather the most points by the end of the game. Navigate the treacherous game board, avoid traps, and gain advantages that can help you steal points, sabotage others, and stay safe in a game of shifting fortunes.</p>
            <p>With a mix of random events, strategic mini-games, and plenty of unpredictable twists, <strong>Overthrone</strong> guarantees that no two games are ever the same. Will you end the game on top, or be left in the dust?</p>
