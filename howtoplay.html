            <h3>Mini-Games</h3>
            <p>At the end of each round, players compete in a random mini-game. The mini-game winner(s) gain extra points based on their placement.</p>
            
            <h4>Snake Game</h4>
            <p>In the Snake Game mini-game, two players control snakes that compete to eat randomly generated fruits and grow longer. There are three types of fruits—orange, apple, and pineapple—which add length and score when eaten. Players can also eat each other’s segments, transferring the eaten part to the snake that ate it, along with the corresponding score. The game includes randomly generated walls that add a challenge, and hitting a wall causes the other player to win. If a snake collides with the other, the segments that were eaten are added to the winner’s snake, and the loser’s score is reduced. The game ends when one player loses by hitting a wall or when the timer runs out. The winner of the Snake Game gains extra points based on their performance.</p>

            <h4>Frog Crossing Game</h4>
            <p>In the Frog Crossing mini-game, players race to cross a busy road filled with randomly generated cars. The game features three roads with six lanes in total, where cars move in opposite directions. Players control their frogs, which can move up, down, or sideways, but not diagonally. The goal is to reach the other side of the road first without being hit by a car. If a frog is hit, the other player wins the round. The game is played in a head-to-head format, where the first frog to cross wins, and the other player earns points based on their placement. Cars move at random speeds, making the game unpredictable and challenging. The winner of the mini-game gains extra points toward the final score.</p>
